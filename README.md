# Rotation

While you are still spelling "Verwaltungseffizienzsteigerungsma√ünahme", we already solved your management overhead.

We enable poor souls who have to write "Berichtshefte" to manage their per-course rotation of who has to write the report in the current cycle.

It especially keeps track of exceptions like people writing the report multiple cycles in a row and then needing to be excluded from the rotation for a few iterations, reducing overall management overhead through this automation.

## Development

Your new jumpstart project includes basic organization with an organized `assets` folder and a `components` folder.
If you chose to develop with the router feature, you will also have a `views` folder.

### Tailwind
1. Install npm: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm
2. Install the Tailwind CSS CLI: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation
3. Run the following command in the root of the project to start the Tailwind CSS compiler:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./assets/tailwind.css --watch
```

### Serving Your App

Run the following command in the root of your project to start developing with the default platform:

```bash
dx serve --platform web
```

To run for a different platform, use the `--platform platform` flag. E.g.
```bash
dx serve --platform desktop
```
